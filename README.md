# projank

An app that helps you decide which project to work on


## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for local development 
- **Vite**: Development environment and build tools
- **CSS**: Standard modern CSS
- **Netlify**: Used to host the site statically

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/skeddles/projank.git
cd projank
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Running the Development Environment

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and provide a local URL to preview the site.

### Building the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the application in the `dist` directory.


## Deployment

To deploy to Netlify, just used `npm run build` as the build command and `dist` as the publish directory.
